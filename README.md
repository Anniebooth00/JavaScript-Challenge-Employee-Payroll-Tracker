# JavaScript-Challenge-Employee-Payroll-Tracker
This week's challenge is about creating an employee payroll tracker application for a payroll manager to view and manage payroll data. The application will run in the browser, with HTML and CSS dynamically updated by JavaScript code that I write. It will feature a responsive and polished user interface, adapting to various screen sizes.
