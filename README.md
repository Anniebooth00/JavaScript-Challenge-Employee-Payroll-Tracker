# JavaScript Challenge: Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description
This week's challenge is about creating an employee payroll tracker application for a payroll manager to view and manage payroll data. The application will run in the browser, with HTML and CSS dynamically updated by JavaScript code that I write. It will feature a responsive and polished user interface, adapting to various screen sizes.

My task is to modify starter code to meet the user story and acceptance criteria provided below.

## Challenge
### User Story
AS A payroll manager,  
I WANT an employee payroll tracker,  
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company.

### Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN an employee payroll tracker, WHEN I click the "Add employee" button, THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary.
- WHEN I finish adding an employee, THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel.
- WHEN I choose to continue, THEN I am prompted to add a new employee.
- WHEN I choose to cancel, THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data.
